**Simple Python Script to Download files from http://www.whdownload.com/**

To run the script you will need Python installed.

Python whdownload.py

Uses multiprocessing so should complete in under 10 mins with good Internet connect.

This script is not fancy, no web scraping, just iteration through a list of links. 

The script will look for a folder (my-amiga-games) in your home directory and if not there create it and download the files there.
